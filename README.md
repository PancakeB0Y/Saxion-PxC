## Overview

You play as Lily, a spirited young girl, wandering through some woods near your home. You stumble upon a dark castle. Intrigued by the castle's looking silhouette, you cautiously approach the aged wooden gate. You step into the castle's interior, an air of darkness envelops you. You find yourself entrapped and swiftly confined within the castle dungeon, the heavy door ominously locking behind you.

Developed in Processing.
